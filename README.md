## SmartVac Bot: Autonomous Obstacle-Avoiding Vacuum Robot
SmartVac Bot is an Arduino-powered autonomous robot designed to navigate and clean spaces efficiently. Equipped with ultrasonic sensors and a servo motor for obstacle detection, the bot intelligently avoids obstacles and adapts its path for maximum coverage. A mini vacuum cleaner attachment allows it to collect dust and debris as it moves, making it a practical solution for small cleaning tasks.

### Key Features
#### Obstacle Detection and Avoidance: 
Utilizes ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles and determine the optimal path forward.

#### Dynamic Speed Control: 
Adjusts speed based on proximity to obstacles, enhancing navigation precision.

#### Servo-Controlled Directional Scanning: 
Servo-mounted sensors enable the bot to “look” left and right, assessing the best direction when encountering objects.

#### Integrated Vacuum Cleaner: 
A small vacuum motor enables dust collection as the bot navigates.
